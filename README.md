# Hockey_Bell
uses a PIC16F84A to turn an old telephone into hockey shift timer.  Intervals between bells can be set on dipswitches between 1 minute and 4:45 in :15 second increments.  A reset button triggers an interrupt that returns the timer to the top of its count.  Uses a transformer wired "backwards" to step up voltage to ring bells.
